# AtmosphereJS
--------------------------

Welcome to the AtmosphereJS Wiki/FAQ!

## What is AtmosphereJS?
AtmosphereJS is a simple HTML5/Canvas API drawing library that allows users to create sky lines and atmospheric effects.

### So... what's available?
Not much at the moment, creation of scalable clouds is kind of working and more features are planned for the future (see below).

### Why create it?
I've created AtmosphereJS as a learning exercise, to help improve my knowledge of HTML5, JavaScript frameworks and the Canvas API.

### What's planned?

The following drawable items are currently planned: 

* A Sun 
* The moon 
* Stars 
* Rain 
* Animation applicable to all of the above.

## Getting started

Add the atmosphere.js file to your html file. The following code snippet provides an example of usage:

var xPos = 100, yPos = 150, scale = 1.0;
var cloud = new Atmosphere.Cloud(context, xPos, yPos, scale); // Where context is a 2d context provided by a canvas object.
cloud.draw();
